I developed this program in a Mac environment, so I’m not sure if it works well on Windows.

There are still many bugs and I am continually fixing them.

At the moment, it’s really a rough program.


However, I believe it will be useful for reading novels or academic papers on a computer in environments where translation features are not available.
